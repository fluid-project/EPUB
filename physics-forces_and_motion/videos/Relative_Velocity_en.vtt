00:00:07.864 --> 00:00:10.917
Lands back in the cart, why is that?

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:14.013
Well it's true that while the ball was in the air

00:00:14.043 --> 00:00:15.973
this guy was moving forward

00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:19.183
but both the ball and the cart, because they are here together

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:21.813
have the same horizontal speed

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:25.813
and by shooting the ball up in the air well that doesn't change the fact

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:27.993
that it has horizontal speed going this way.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:30.043
So as the cart moves forward

00:00:30.043 --> 00:00:32.283
and for the amount of time it takes for the ball to go up and down,

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:36.053
the ball is also moving forward in that same amount of time.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:40.056
Now let's do something even more interesting.

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:42.116
Let's have the cart.

00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:43.653
Whoops. That looks very good

00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:46.083
Let's have the cart accelerate.

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:50.201
So I will prop this guy up

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:52.653
with some books

00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:02.097
and now we have a ramp, so now the cart is accelerating.

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:06.738
The question is, now the ball will be shot up in the air

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:09.096
with some horizontal speed

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.346
the cart also has that horizontal speed

00:01:11.346 --> 00:01:13.916
but while the ball is in the air

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.036
the cart is accelerating

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:18.696
will the ball land back in the cart?

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:19.971
Well let's find out.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:25.809
Landed back in the cart!

00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.651
How can that be? This guy was accelerating down the ramp.

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:31.221
Well there are two ways to think about it.

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:33.453
One is, well the ball was accelerating too.

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:37.433
A simpler way to think about it, in my view is that

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:41.393
yes this guy was accelerating, so he is moving faster

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:45.573
but the ball when he landed back in cart the cart was at a lower height.

00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:48.133
So the ball spent more time in the air

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.963
so the ball also had more time to move forward.
